# IER-DML Dataset README  
## Datasets Overview  
This document provides an overview of the datasets designed for the IER-DML project. These datasets aim to address the challenges of incrementally resolving and disambiguating entity descriptions in dynamic environments. We have adopted and extended benchmark datasets provided by DeepMatcher, covering various domains such as products, citations, and restaurant names. Each dataset consists of entities originating from two associated relational tables, with each entity possessing multiple attributes. 
## Dataset Construction  
Please refer to Section 5.1.4 (Experimental Settings) of the paper for a detailed step-by-step process.  
## Addition & Description  
Due to the paper being unpublished and the project involving confidential content, we are currently only disclosing a portion of the IER-DML incremental dataset for official presentation. The complete dataset and its construction methods will be fully open to the public after the paper is published.
